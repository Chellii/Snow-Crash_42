In this level, we are faced with a tremendous challenge, we found ourselves
face to face with a wild perl file. It seems like it is some kind of web
application found on the spacehsip of roswell. With lots of work we made sense
of the code. it gets the x param from the link and echos it. but alas for
whoever wrote this the x param is EXECUTABLE,so an easy `getflag` prints the
flag in the browser. Easiest flag of my life~
