when we opened this level we got a message about mail. After investigation we
found that there is a priviledged cron job that runs every 2 mins. this job
loops over files in /opt/openarenaserver/ , executes them, then deletes them.
We cannot get the output of commands because the privildged runner is not the
user. so we just redirect the output to the /tmp/ folder. Thus getting the
flag.
echo `getflag` > /tmp/file
